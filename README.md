# Dotify [Zhewen Zheng]

This is a music player app with songs in a list. You can shuffle the list by clicking "Shuffle".
You can refresh the list by pulling down. Visiting the settings in the Music Player screen you can
turn on **auto refresh**. This sends a notification about a random song every 20 minutes. Click the
notification to open the song in the player.
Details about a song can be accessed following the instructions below.

## Extra credit (Attempted)
1. FOR DOTIFY project ONLY: In requirement 2.b.v.2, tapping the notification should launch PlayerActivity
that passes the song data to the activity to show the song in the player (+1)
2. In a separate function, create another separate alternative work request that runs every 2 days when
the deviceâ€™s battery is not too low and is connected to a network. For credit, you just need the request
code in your WorkManager class, no other code is required. (+.25)
